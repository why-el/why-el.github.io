Welcome to a basic perceptron simulation. This tool demonstrates a simple algorithm's ability to classify data into two categories. On this 2D canvas, you will plot points representing two scenarios, such as areas in a garden with different sunlight exposure.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Task:</strong> Mark sunny spots with <strong>blue</strong> and shaded areas with <strong>red</strong>. These points are your training set, which teaches the perceptron to differentiate between sunny and shaded based on their canvas positions. After plotting, press the <strong>Iterate</strong> button repeatedly to start the perceptron's learning, which tries to draw a separating line between the points.
</p>

<p>
The placement of your points influences the perceptron's learning efficiency. A clear separation helps it quickly learn the distinction. With each iteration, the model adjusts its decision line to classify the spots accurately. Experiment with different point placements and observe the adjustments.
</p>

<p>
You can also experiment with the initial weights and learning rate, key parameters that affect the model's learning behavior. However, the perceptron is most effective when the data is linearly separable. If points are mixed without a clear division, finding a separating line may not be possible, highlighting the need for appropriate model and feature selection.
</p>

<p>
This simulation offers a hands-on experience with machine learning, showing how algorithms learn from data to make predictions.

  In this simulation, the initial weights and bias you set serve as starting points for the perceptron's decision line—the demarcation that differentiates the blue and red classes on the canvas. The weights impact the line's orientation, affecting how the model evaluates the importance of each axis for classification. Meanwhile, the bias shifts this line without changing its tilt, akin to an offset, enabling it to encapsulate the division between classes more effectively. Once you've chosen the initial values, the perceptron takes over, automatically adjusting these parameters based on the training set you provided. This iterative adjustment is the model's learning process, striving to refine the decision boundary to accurately separate new points according to the examples given. Your role is to plot the training points and observe how the model learns to classify them, showcasing the fundamental principles of machine learning in action.
