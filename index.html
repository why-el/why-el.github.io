Polished version coming soon, I guess? Been saying that since 2016. :)</br></br>

I am 34, and I live in Cambridge, MA. I work for <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://vendr.com">Vendr</a> as a Principal Engineer. Before that, I was at Grubuhb.

Before joining Grubhub, I was working in the the Telematics industry in Germany (car software and hardware). I also worked on indoor navigation systems and did various agency projects, also in Germany. Waaaay before that, I worked in the health industry in Brazil. </br></br> 

After college, I did a freight exchange startup in my home country of Morocco called <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="http://wamova.com">Wamova</a>.It did not pan out, we even lost the website :joy:, but we learned a ton. </br></br> 

In addition to my varied technical responsibilities, I have a deep interest in linguistics, especially the generative paradigm.
